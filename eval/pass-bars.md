# Pass bars

What each graph-related change must show before it merges (epic CON-E3). The bars were written on 2026-10-24,
before any of these features or their results existed. A change merges only when it passes every gate in its row.

## Rules for every row

- **Held-out only.** A bar is judged on the `test` split, scored once per design. Tuning uses the `dev` split.
- **Significance.** A gain counts only when the harness's Holm-corrected paired permutation test gives p < 0.05.
  When the report's minimum detectable effect is larger than the bar, the result is "not shown", which fails.
- **Same baseline.** The comparison is against the `hybrid` config (the app's defaults) built from the commit the
  change branches from, on the same machine and embedding model.
- **No regression.** `v1`, `enterprise-v1` and `pdfqa-v1` (and `links-v1` for rows that are not about links) show
  no dataset with a significant drop in nDCG@10 (pdfqa-v1: MRR@10, its passage metric).
- **No leaks.** The permission-leak suite (CON-31) passes with zero failures. A leak fails the change whatever
  its quality numbers are.
- **Cost.** Index time is the harness's `indexed in` log line; latency is the report's p95 per dataset. AI tokens
  are counted at the providers; zero means no LLM call at index or query time.
- **A change that fails is dropped or redesigned, never merged.** A redesign is judged on a fresh held-out set
  (a new snapshot or a new seed), because the old one has been seen. A bar is never changed after a result
  exists; a new bar is committed first and needs a fresh held-out set.

## Bars

| Change | Better | No regression | Cost and speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engine link layer, off** | Every suite's ranked results identical to the baseline | — | Index time and p95 within run-to-run noise |
| **Engine link layer, on** (no source writes links) | Identical rankings on sources without links | All suites | Index +10% at most, p95 +10% at most, 0 AI tokens |
| **Linked sources** (GitHub issues/PRs, Jira, Confluence links) | `links-v1` test MRR@10 at least +0.05 over the baseline; Recall@10 at least +0.10 on the list kinds (`gh-subissues`, `gh-siblings`, `gh-epic-delivery`, `jira-duplicate`, `jira-subtasks`, `jira-siblings`); no `hops:` or `kind:` group with a significant drop | All suites, plus ordinary GitHub and Jira questions in `enterprise-v1` (`source:` breakdown) | Sync/index +10% at most, p95 +150 ms at most, 0 AI tokens |
| **Code retrieval** (suite `code-v1`, to be built; answer keys from a compiler-grade indexer) | Definition questions Hit@1 ≥ 0.95; caller/usage Recall@10 at least +0.15 over a grep baseline; parser call edges at high confidence ≥ 0.90 precision against the compiler's; "how does X work" MRR@10 at least +0.05 over the baseline | All suites | Under 1 s per changed file, a full Connapse checkout under 2 min, symbol lookups p95 under 300 ms, 0 AI tokens |
| **Agent memory** (suite `memory-v1`, to be built; answer keys from a scripted fact timeline) | Current-value, as-of-date and what-changed questions at least +0.10 Recall@5 over the same notes stored as plain documents | All suites; ordinary recall questions no significant drop against plain documents | A write lands in under 200 ms, recall p95 +150 ms at most, 0 AI tokens on the server |
| **AI link extraction** (opt-in) | `links-v1` test MRR@10 at least +0.05 over links-only | All suites | Reported: tokens per passage, index time; no default-on without a new bar |
| **Container memory for search** (suite `memory-search-v1`, CON-244; see below) | Correct-document score on the memory tasks at least +0.15 over the same agent without memory | Control and stale tasks non-inferior within 0.10 | Reported: search calls, tool calls and tokens per task |
| **Learned container memory** (suite `memory-learned-v1`, CON-244; see below) | Same rule, session-2 memory tasks, memory written by session-1 agents | Same rule, session-2 control and stale tasks | Reported: session-1 scores and facts written |

## Container memory for search (CON-244)

**Result:** the planted-memory arm passed, but the realistic arm below came back WORSE, so container memory was
dropped and CON-255 removed it. The rules here stay as the record. The `memory-search` and `memory-learned` commands
now run only the Off arm, and the Off scores in `eval/agent-search/con-244/results.md` are the ones to match.

Written on 2026-11-04, before the `memory-search` command or any scored run existed. The result decides whether
container-level memory stays in the product: **keep** it only if it clearly beats plain search; **drop** it if it is
no better or worse.

- **Arms.** Both run the same agent, model, system prompt, questions and repetitions. **Off** has
  `search_knowledge` and `get_document`, as an agent searches today. **On** adds only `memory_recall`. Nothing tells
  the agent to use memory. The tool descriptions are the MCP server's own.
- **Fixed before the run:**
  - **Model:** `claude-sonnet-5-5` with adaptive thinking at effort `medium` and no temperature (amended before any
    run: the model rejects a temperature, so runs are not deterministic and the 3 repetitions carry the variance).
    If ClaudePM's go names another model, the change is committed here before the run.
  - **Repetitions:** 3 per task and arm, averaged per task before any test.
  - **Limits:** at most 12 tool calls per run. `search_knowledge` returns its default 10 results in Hybrid mode.
  - **Split:** the 112 `test` tasks, scored once. The `dev` tasks are for building and checking the command only.
  - **Exclusions:** none. A provider error is retried up to 3 times; a run that still fails, runs out of tool calls
    or never answers scores 0, and the count of such runs is reported per arm.
- **Score per run:** 1 when the documents the agent cites include a gold document and no labelled stale document,
  else 0. A task's score is the mean over its repetitions.
- **Sets:** **M** is the 64 current, alias, correction and location tasks. **H** is the 48 control and stale tasks.
- **Verdicts** (difference = On − Off, paired by task):
  - **KEEP** only when both hold:
    1. on M the mean difference is at least +0.15, its 95% BCa interval lies above 0, and the permutation p < 0.05;
    2. on H the lower end of the 90% BCa interval is above −0.10.

    Both must pass, so each is tested at α = 0.05 with no Holm split (an intersection-union test).
  - **WORSE** when the 95% interval of the difference over all 112 tasks lies below 0, or when H's mean
    difference is below 0 and the lower end of its 90% interval is at or below −0.10.
  - **NO BETTER** for every other result.
  - **WORSE and NO BETTER both mean DROP.**
- **Minimum detectable effect.** The report gives the minimum detectable effect for M and H. If it is above 0.15 on
  M and KEEP fails, the report says the run could not tell a tie from a 0.15 gain; the verdict is still DROP.
- **Reported, not gated:** each kind separately, documented and undocumented halves, answer-value accuracy, stale
  citations, run recall of gold documents, first-query MRR@10, search and tool calls with their intervals, tokens,
  and a few answers memory changed for better and for worse.

### Learned container memory (CON-244, realistic arm)

Written on 2026-11-05, before the `memory-learned` command or any scored run existed. The memory-search run above
seeds memory by hand, so it cannot say whether memory an agent writes for itself helps. This arm can, and **the
keep-or-drop decision for container memory rests on it.**

- **Dataset:** `memory-learned` (suite `memory-learned-v1`): every fact a task needs is in a document.
- **Per repetition, in a fresh container holding the corpus:**
  1. **Session 1.** An agent answers each session-1 test question with `search_knowledge`, `get_document`,
     `memory_recall`, `memory_remember` and `memory_correct`. Its system prompt asks it to save what it learned that
     would help answer related questions later, citing the documents. Nothing else is written into memory.
  2. The late documents are uploaded and indexed.
  3. **Session 2.** A fresh agent answers each session-2 test question twice, with the original memory-search system
     prompt, which never mentions memory: **Off** has `search_knowledge` and `get_document`; **On** adds only
     `memory_recall`, reading what session 1 wrote. Both sessions use the same user.
- **Fixed as above:** model, effort, 3 repetitions, 12 tool calls per run, Hybrid search with 10 results, retries,
  exclusions, the score per run, the paired statistics and the KEEP, WORSE and NO BETTER rules. Only session-2 test
  tasks are scored: **M** is the 64 current, alias, correction and location tasks, **H** the 28 control and 12 stale
  tasks, 104 in all.
- **Reported, not gated:** everything listed above, plus session-1 scores and the facts session 1 wrote (how many,
  how many cite documents).
- **Budget:** one full run (228 session-1 and 624 session-2 runs) must use at most about 5% of the seven-day
  subscription window, on the subscription only.

## Check-by dates on a copy of the ClaudePM memory space (CON-340)

Written on 2026-11-12, before the export or any run. The question is whether check-by dates take facts that are no
longer true out of the list of current facts ClaudePM reads at session start, without losing any fact.

- **Data:** one read-only export of the live `claudepm` space (`status=all`), loaded into a throwaway database. The
  live space is never written.
- **Replay:** every current fact is saved again through the real memory service and store, in the order it was
  recorded, with the clock set to its recorded time. The copy's space gets fixed defaults before the replay:
  `waiting_on` 7 days and `status` 14 days. Every other attribute has no default, and no fact carries its own date.
  Recall then runs at the export time.
- **Session-start split:** the harness rebuilds ClaudePM's list of decisions and rules (current facts whose attribute
  is not `lesson`, `worker`, `finding` or `note`). Facts recalled as unconfirmed go into a "check these" list, and
  the rest stay in the current list.
- **Stale facts:** a current fact whose subject or value names a CON ticket that the PM's status list marks as merged
  or dropped. This list is fixed before the run, and the export is not looked at before then.
- **Pass, all of these:**
  1. No stale fact is in the current list. Before the change, the count is the number of stale facts; after, it is 0.
     This includes the `waiting_on` facts for CON-307 and CON-335.
  2. Every current fact in the copy appears in exactly one of the two lists.
  3. Recall returns as many current facts as the copy holds; none is dropped or hidden.
- **Reported, not gated:** facts in "check these" that are not stale (still true, but asked to be checked), by
  attribute.
