# Public Release Preparation Checklist

> **Note**: This document was originally written before v0.2.0. Authentication was completed in v0.2.0, and cloud connectors + identity linking were completed in v0.3.0. Some sections below are historical and no longer reflect current state. See README.md and SECURITY.md for the current status.

**Branch**: `feature/public-release-prep`
**Target**: Open-source repository with future commercial cloud hosting
**License Strategy**: Permissive (MIT or Apache 2.0) to allow adoption while building hosted service

---

## 🎯 Release Strategy

### Business Model
- ✅ **Open Source Core**: Full codebase under permissive license
- 🎯 **Commercial Hosting**: Managed cloud service (future revenue stream)
- 📖 **Community Building**: GitHub stars, contributors, feedback loop

### Similar Successful Models
- Supabase (Apache 2.0 + hosted)
- GitLab (MIT + hosted)
- Sentry (BSL + hosted)
- PostHog (MIT + hosted)

---

## 📋 Critical Tasks (MUST DO)

### 1. License Selection ⚠️ BLOCKER
**Status**: [ ] Not started

Choose between:
- **MIT License** (Recommended)
  - ✅ Most permissive, encourages adoption
  - ✅ Allows commercial use (users can self-host or modify)
  - ✅ You retain rights to offer commercial hosted version
  - ✅ Simple, well-understood

- **Apache 2.0**
  - ✅ Same benefits as MIT
  - ✅ Includes explicit patent grant (more protection)
  - ⚠️ Slightly more complex

**Action**: Create `LICENSE` file with chosen license

---

### 2. Security Documentation ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status**: [ ] Not started

#### A. Create SECURITY.md
Document:
- ⚠️ **NO AUTHENTICATION** - Project is pre-alpha, development only
- ⚠️ **NOT PRODUCTION READY** - Anyone with network access can read/modify/delete data
- How to report vulnerabilities (email or GitHub Security tab)
- Roadmap for auth implementation

#### B. Update README.md with Security Warnings
Add prominent warning at top:
```markdown
## ⚠️ Security Notice

**This project is in pre-alpha development and NOT production-ready.**

- ❌ No authentication or authorization
- ❌ No rate limiting (added in v0.3.2)
- ❌ Default development credentials included
- ✅ Suitable for local development and testing only

**DO NOT** deploy to public networks without implementing authentication first.
```

#### C. Update appsettings.json
Add comment at top:
```json
{
  "_comment": "⚠️ DEVELOPMENT CREDENTIALS - Change these for any deployment!",
  ...
}
```

#### D. Create .env.example
Template for users to copy and customize:
```bash
# Database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_me_in_production
# MinIO
MINIO_ROOT_USER=change_me
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=change_me_strong_password
```

---

### 3. README.md Expansion ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Status**: [ ] Not started

Current README is 13 lines. Expand to include:

```markdown
# Connapse

> Open-source AI-powered knowledge management platform. Transform documents into searchable knowledge for AI agents.

⚠️ **Pre-Alpha**: Development only. No authentication. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Features

## Commercial Hosting

While Connapse is open source and free to self-host, we will offer a **managed cloud service** for teams who want:
- Zero-ops deployment
- Automatic backups & scaling
- Enterprise support
- SLA guarantees

## 📝 Notes

### Authentication Implementation (v0.2.0) — COMPLETED
Authentication was fully implemented in v0.2.0:
- ASP.NET Core Identity for password auth (cookie + JWT + PATs)
- Agent API keys for MCP and automation
- Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer, Agent)
- Invite-only registration
- Cloud identity linking added in v0.3.0 (AWS IAM Identity Center + Azure AD)

### Open Source + Commercial Hosting Model
This model works when:
✅ Open source builds community & trust
✅ Self-hosting is possible but requires effort
✅ Hosted service adds value (convenience, support, SLA)
✅ Clear boundaries (core features = free, premium features = paid, OR hosting = paid)

Your model: **Core features free, hosting paid** (like Supabase, GitLab)

---
