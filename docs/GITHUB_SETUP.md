### 4. Configure Branch Protection Rules

**Location**: Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule

  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Select: "build", "test" (after CI workflow is created)
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ❌ **Require signed commits** (optional, more strict)
- ❌ **Require linear history** (optional, prevents merge commits)
- ✅ **Include administrators** (apply rules to admins too)

---

### 5. Configure Issue Labels

### 7. Update Badge URLs in README.md

**After pushing to GitHub**, update the badge URLs in [README.md](../README.md):

The badge URLs in README.md already use the correct repository path (`Destrayon/Connapse`):
```markdown
[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Destrayon/Connapse/ci.yml?branch=main&label=build)](https://github.com/Destrayon/Connapse/actions)
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-171%20passing-success)](https://github.com/Destrayon/Connapse/actions)
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)
[![GitHub Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Destrayon/Connapse)](https://github.com/Destrayon/Connapse/issues)
[![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Destrayon/Connapse?style=social)](https://github.com/Destrayon/Connapse/stargazers)
```

Also update URLs in:
- [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml)
- Any CI/CD workflows that reference the repository

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow (Optional but Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to enable the build badge:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: '10.0.x'

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --configuration Release --verbosity normal
```

This will:
- ✅ Run builds on every push to main/develop
- ✅ Run builds on every pull request
- ✅ Execute all tests
- ✅ Update the build badge status

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After completing the manual configuration:

- [ ] Repository description is set
- [ ] Topics/tags are added (for discoverability)
- [ ] GitHub Discussions is enabled
- [ ] Security tab is enabled with alerts
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured for `main`
- [ ] Custom issue labels are created
- [ ] Pull request settings are configured
- [ ] Badge URLs in README.md are updated with correct username
- [ ] (Optional) CI/CD workflow is created and running
- [ ] Test all issue templates by creating test issues
- [ ] Test PR template by creating a test PR

---

## 📝 Notes

### Repository URLs

All repository URLs and badge paths use `Destrayon/Connapse`. If you fork this repository, update these references to match your fork's path.

### Why These Settings Matter

- **Topics**: Help users discover your project through GitHub search
- **Discussions**: Better for Q&A than issues, reduces issue clutter
- **Security Tab**: Critical for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- **Branch Protection**: Prevents accidental direct commits to main
- **Labels**: Helps organize and prioritize issues effectively
- **CI/CD**: Automated quality checks, builds trust with contributors
